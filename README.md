# dynamic-array-algorithms-cpp
C++ implementations of array-based algorithms using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.  
Includes geometric sequence generation, cross-correlation of numerical arrays, duplicate handling,  
and safe memory deallocation. Focuses on correctness, edge cases, and manual memory management.
## Build
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 array_algorithms.cpp -o array_algorithms
```
